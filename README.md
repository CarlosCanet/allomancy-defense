# Allomancy Defense

# Introduction
Allomancy Defense is a game developed in a week for the Ironhack web development bootcamp, in July 2025. It is based in the Mistborn series of Brandon Sanderson, because the Cosmere is where we all live in.

# Mechanics
You control a mistborn (you can choose which type) and you are trying to rise a revolution against Lord Ruler. There are some mechanics from idle game and from tower defense games.
