## [Play the Game!](https://carloscanet.github.io/allomancy-defense/)

# Description
**Allomancy Defense** is a game developed in a week for the M1 project of the Ironhack web development bootcamp, in July 2025. It is based in the Mistborn series of *Brandon Sanderson*, because the Cosmere is where we all live in.

**Allomancy defense** is a game where you need to gather resources to build your rebellion. To do this, you have two options: get resources from your base and build new structures, but over time your efficiency decreases. At any time, you can make an incursion into Luthadel and get even more resources, but the Lord Rulerâ€™s guards are looking for you! If they catch you, you lose resources and buildings, and if you have 0 buildings left, your rebellion fails.

## File structure
The `main.ts` file contains the main DOM containers, creates the main  _AllomancyDefenseGame_ class instance and starts the game.

In the `AllomancyDefenseGame.ts` we have the constants and nodes needed for the entire game, as well as the main loop.

We also have a separate file for each class and auxiliary constants.
